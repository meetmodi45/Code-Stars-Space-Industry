        <h2>Welcome to the Journey of India's Space Achievements</h2>
        <p>India has made significant strides in the space industry. From launching satellites to sending missions to
            the Moon and Mars, ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) has achieved many milestones.The Indian space
            sector is recognised for building cost-effective satellites with launch of the Mars probes successfully at
            first attempt and taking hundreds of foreign satellites to space. India constitutes 2-3% of the global space
            economy and is expected to enhance its share to more than 10% by 2030</p>

                        Chandrayaan-3 was launched aboard an LVM3-M4 rocket on 14 July 2023, at 09:05 UTC from Satish
                        Dhawan
                        Space Centre Second Launch Pad in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, India, entering an Earth parking
                        orbit
                        with a perigee of 170 km (106 mi) and an apogee of 36,500 km (22,680 mi).<br>

                        <div class="more-info">The primary objective of Chandrayaan-3 mission was to demonstrate soft
                            landing near
                            to lunar south polar region and perform experiments using the instruments on Vikram and
                            Pragyaan.The
                            spacecraft was launched on July 14, 2023 on-board LVM3-M4 vehicle from SDSC, SHAR. On August
                            23rd Vikram
                            Lander made its historic touch down on Moon and subsequently Pragyan rover was deployed. The
                            scientific
                            instruments in Lander and Rover were operated continuously for 1 lunar day as per the
                            defined mission
                            life. The mission objectives of Chandrayaan-3 have been completely met. With regard to
                            Propulsion Module,
                            the main objective was to ferry the Lander module from GTO to the final lunar polar circular
                            orbit and
                            separate the Lander. Subsequent to separation, Spectro-polarimetry of HAbitable Planet Earth
                            (SHAPE)
                            payload in the PM was also operated. The initial plan was to operate this payload for about
                            three months
                            during the mission life of PM. The precise orbit injection by LVM3 and optimal earth / lunar
                            burn maneuvers,
                            resulted in the availability of over 100 kg of fuel in the PM after over one month of
                            operations in the lunar
                            orbit. It was decided to use the available fuel in the PM to derive additional information
                            for future lunar
                            missions and demonstrate the mission operation strategiesfor a sample return mission</div>

                        Aditya-L1 will stay approximately 1.5 million km away from Earth, directed towards the Sun,
                        which is about 1% of the
                        Earth-Sun distance. The Sun is a giant sphere of gas and Aditya-L1 would study the outer
                        atmosphere of the Sun.
                        Aditya-L1 will neither land on the Sun nor approach the Sun any closer

                            The strategic placement at the L1 Lagrange point ensures that Aditya-L1 can maintain a
                            constant, uninterrupted view
                            of the Sun. This location also allows the satellite to access solar radiation and magnetic
                            storms before they are
                            influenced by Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere. Additionally, the L1 point’s
                            gravitational stability
                            minimizes the need for frequent orbital maintenance efforts, optimizing the satellite's
                            operational efficiency.
